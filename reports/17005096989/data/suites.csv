    Test of Autonomous Emergency Braking, in the Car to car rear braking scenario.
    The scenario parameters for the ego vehicle velocity and the distance to its fellow vehicle is parameterized.
    Parameter Variation is full factorial. All combinations of specified parameter values are applied by pytest.
